    Now <when> you climb <> in<to> your bed tonight
    And when you lock, and bolt the door
    Just think of those out in the cold and dark
    Cause there's not enough love to go round

    Now half the world hurts the other half
    And half the world has all the food
    And half the world lies down and quietly starves
